I'm Swapnil Patel, a software engineer working on compilers and performance at Anaconda.
Before this, I spent several years at Intel working on data center benchmarks, low-level profiling, and system architecture.
I mostly work close to the metalâ€”Python runtimes, distributed systems, and platform tuning.
Outside of code, I like photography, generative art, film cameras, and espresso. I live in Santa Clara, California.
