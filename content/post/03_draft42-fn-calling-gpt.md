I've been working on a simple chatbot app using Streamlit. 
Intentions for the project:
- Utilize Streamlit to create interactive frontend components, providing a seamless user experience.
- Define functions within the application as Pydantic models, leveraging the 'instructor' framework for enhanced structure and validation. This helps switch between different GPT models with ease- openAI as well as local models with ollama.
- Experiment with different GPT models and their capabilities to handle choices of tools, function-calling and context-understanding.

The code is quite rough, but wanted to put it out there for feedback and suggestions. I'm looking forward to improving the code and adding more features to it.

Here is a snapshot of bot in action:
