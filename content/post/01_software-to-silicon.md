Hello!

I'm Swapnil Patel-

This blog is a record of my work on computer systems and making them run faster.

I've been writing code for most of my life. I started in India and now I work in California. Both places have lots of tech jobs.

I like working on systems that use many computers together.

At Intel, I learned about how CPUs work. I studied things like how fast CPUs run, how to save power, and how to make software applications like Nginx and Redis work better at single node level as well as Datacenter scale.

My job has been about two main things:
1. How to make better computer architecture for software
2. How to write software that work well on those architectures

I found out that writing good code isn't just about smart math or using less memory. It's also about understanding how the layout of the silicon works when there's traffic. Sometimes, the chip cares more about how data moves around inside it than how clever your code is.

I intend to write more about my learnings and experiences here.

Thank you for reading!
