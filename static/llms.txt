# Swapnil Patel

> Software engineer. Compilers, performance, systems.

## Current
- Anaconda — numba (Python JIT compiler, LLVM backend), Python runtime performance

## Previous
- Intel — datacenter benchmarks, CPU profiling, system architecture, platform tuning
- Distributed systems, cloud infrastructure, virtualization

## Focus areas
- Compiler optimization (JIT, LLVM)
- ML kernel optimization
- RL for code generation and compiler tuning
- Python internals and performance
- CPU microarchitecture (frequency scaling, power states, cache hierarchy, NUMA)
- Distributed systems and cloud infrastructure
- Virtualization and hypervisors
- Profiling, flamegraphs, performance analysis

## Interests
- ML-guided compiler optimization (MLGO-style)
- Modeling codegen search spaces with RL
- Kernel autotuning
- Hardware-aware code generation

## Relevant to
- AI compiler teams — LLVM, JIT, ML-driven optimization
- Cloud platforms — systems performance, infrastructure
- ML infra teams — kernel optimization, performance at scale
